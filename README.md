## corelib.ai

corelib.ai is a completely open and free software framework for creating AI based applications.  corelib.ai includes common data structures, algorithms and architectures which enables developers to build applications requiring:

- **Machine Learning** *(ML) (predictions)*
- **Computer Vision** *(CV) (i.e. object and facial recognition)*
- **Natural Language Processing** *(NLP)*
- **Visual Hashing** *(i.e. pHash)*
- **Audio Fingerprinting** *(i.e. acoustid)*
- **Secure Data Exchanging** *(i.e. Homomorphic encrytpion, hashing)*
- **Distributed Computing** (*i.e. decentralization)*
- **High Performance Computing** *(i.e. GPU, TPU, DPU optimizations)*
- And more...

### Goals
corelib.ai is following the path of AI as a whole. This means the intent is to go from ANI (narrow AI) to AGI (general AI) and beyond. With that in mind the corelib.ai project goals are as follows:

- Dismistify AI for developers
- Bring AI out of research into mainstream
- Reduce developer dependency on 3rd party components
- Pave the way to future AI technologies

| Demystify AI | Research to Mainstream | Dependency Reduction | Guiding Light |
| :------ | :------ | :------- | :------: |
| corelib.ai demystifies AI by removing the need for developers to understand the inner guts of each and every thing that comprises the technology. <br><br> For example, developers today don't need to worry or think about how a Hash Table or Linked List works internally yet they can still use these data structures to make their applications. <br><br>The same applies here.  | corelib.ai brings AI concepts out of research and into mainstream so that each developer from all walks of life can easily leverage the technology. Much of AI technology today is buried within heaps of research papers, documents and experiments. <br><br>Often times, its cluttered with theoretical topics and advanced mathematics which are not easily translated over to the day to day life of a developer. corelib.ai in a sense translates this to the practical. <br><br>From research - to the practical. | Experts in the AI space have to understand a broad set of components in order to employ even the simplest of AI techniques in a real world scenario. <br><br>This alone creates barriers to entry for developers. If a developer wants to deploy any AI solution, they will likely need to understand 5-10 different components and that's just scratching the surface. <br><br>corelib.ai makes this easier by merging these concepts into an easy to use and simplistic interface. | AI solutions today are scattered at best. Each finding a niche and carving their way through that niche. <br><br>The issue with this is that the end goal of many of these solutions is not necessarily that of AI - but rather - that of their specific niche.<br><br> corelib.ai is following the path from ANI to AGI and beyond. When we get there is a different story. |

### Who is this for?
corelib.ai is for software developers ranging from no experience in AI to a full on AI expert. The goal is to get you out of the guts of AI and get you making solutions now with little to no barriers.

### How does corelib.ai compare to others?

That's just it - there are little to no frameworks or solutions to date that merge these different concepts into one easy to use interface. Many of the solutions on the market still require developers to learn a myriad of libraries, tools and solutions in order to make the most basic of AI implementations into a production system.
